    fullText: <div><p>On February 9, WECS hosted a tote bag paint night, offering a creative outlet for students to unwind and express themselves. Set in a relaxed atmosphere, participants were provided with all the necessary supplies to transform plain tote bags into personalized works of art. The evening was filled with laughter and lively discussions, as attendees shared experiences and ideas, both about their academic journeys and the masterpieces they were creating.
      The paint night also served as a platform for networking, allowing students to connect with peers and seniors in a non-traditional setting. It highlighted the importance of community and support among women pursuing careers in STEM, showcasing that creativity and innovation go hand in hand.
      By the end of the night, each participant left with a unique tote bag, a symbol of their creativity and a reminder of the empowering community they are a part of. This event was a testament to the club's commitment to fostering a supportive and inclusive environment for women in engineering and computer science.
      Thank you to all of our attendees and the execs that made this event happen! We look forward to more fun community events in the coming months.</p>
